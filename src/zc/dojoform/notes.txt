Dojoform Notes
==============

dojo.requires
-------------

By default dojoform will pull in all the dojo, dijit, and dojox modules that
it may need to build whatever widgets it supports out of the box.

Ideally we'd like to add support for lazily requiring these modules, but
for now we're punting.

If you know what dojoform is going to need required through dojo.requires
and you want to avoid loading a lot more than that, you can define a global
before requiring zc.dojo that will prevent these loads:

    zc_dojo_norequires

If this global has any value other than undefined, dojoform will not require
anything.
