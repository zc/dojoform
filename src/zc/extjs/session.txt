Supporting session authentication
=================================

Session authentication provides a challenge for AJAX applications.
For normal page loads, the user is redirected to a login page. This
isn't useful for AJAX requests.  The zc.extjs package provides an
Unauthorized error view that return a JSON page with a session_expired
flag set if the request has an X-Requested-With header set to
xmlhttprequest.

To get this view, you need to include session.zcml::

  <include package="zc.extjs" file="session.zcml" />

Tou need to do this before zope.app.exception.browser is included::

  <include package="zope.app.zcmlfiles" file="meta.zcml" />
  <include package="zc.extjs" file="session.zcml" />


We have a calculator application set up [#application]_.  If we access
it using an ordinary unauthenticated browser, we get an unauthorized error:

    >>> import zope.testbrowser.testing
    >>> browser = zope.testbrowser.testing.Browser()
    >>> browser.open('http://localhost/@@index.html/about')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    httperror_seek_wrapper: HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized

We get an unauthorized error, rather than getting redirected because
we're using basic authentication in the test setup.  Had we been using
session authentication, we'd have been redirected.

If we set the X-Requested-With header:

    >>> browser.addHeader('X-Requested-With', 'XMLHTTPRequest')
    >>> browser.open('http://localhost/@@index.html/about')
    >>> browser.contents
    '{"session_expired": true, "success": false}'
