Notes on implementing form widgets
==================================

API:

   - General widget crap. :)  Hopefully, _Widget isn't too obtrusive

   - Must define domNode, may define containerNode

   - buildRendering() is where you build up your widgets dom.

   - reset() Reset widget values to initial settings

   - focus() Give widget focus

     At least as far as forms are converned, this is only used to give
     focus to invalid fields. :/.

   - isValid() -> Test whether current input is valid

   - validate() -> bool Test whether current input is valid

     Documentation for form.validate says it updates validation
     markers. Sigh.

   - name attr used by form's value getters and setters to find form widgets.

     Important note: Don't set name on internal subwidgets. If you do,
     they'll end up in form values.

   - startup() Implement this if you have children that need startup
     to get called on them!

   - onChange  Call this when you're state changes

     Note that because form uses getDescendants, it will connect to
     your onChange, as well as your children's.

Note

  The form implementation uses getDescendants to find it's
  contents.  This means that it considered subwidgets part of its
  contents, including widgets you might think of as private.

  It filters widgets to those that have names only when getting or
  setting values, not when validating or resetting.  I consider this a
  bug, it doubt it will change, unless maybe in 2, as fixing it would
  break old code.

  Because of the above behavior, you may be able to avoid implementing
  validation and reset methods if you're widget is implemented in
  terms of subwidgets.
