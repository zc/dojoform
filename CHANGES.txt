0.13.0 (2010-04-27)
===================

- Removed call to .startup() on form; it is the client's job to start the form
  after optionally adding additional widgets to it.
- Added a rich text widget (zc.ajaxform.widgets.RichText).
- Made the rich text widget's height and width configurable via display
  options.
- Bug fix: zope.schema.Text was errantly given a rich text widget.  It now uses
  a plain text widget.
- Bug fix (I think): removed some style ("width:100%") from the right
  ContentPane that caused the form to be too wide.


0.10.0 through 0.12.0
=====================

Missing change log.

0.7.0 (2009-11-24)
==================

- Added a `postStartup` hook for widgets, called after form startup.
- Added a CKEditor widget as an optional replacement for the Dojo WYSIWYG

- Added `ComboBox` widget.
- Fixed text selection on display widgets.
- Changed the rich-text display widget to be an `iframe` instead of a full
  Dojo rich-text editor.
