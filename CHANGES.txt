0.18.0 (unreleased)
===================

- Add date and time widgets.

- Add UI improvements for dialogs when using Dojo 1.5.

- Clean up dependencies.

- Make the highest-level container a dijit.form.Form, so that 
  widgets can easily be validated on the client-side by calling
  the form's validate method.

- Reinstate default automatic form startup (added back in 0.16.2), and add
  an argument `startup` to `build_form` to control the behavior.

- Add a workaround to the "Add/Modify Record" dialog for an issue with
  text fields in CKEditor pop-ups not being editable.

0.17.0 (2010-07-12)
===================

- Add convenience function (zc.dojo.alert) for displaying alert messages.

- Add convenience function (zc.dojo.confirm) for displaying confirmation
  dialogs.

- Make zope.schema.List widget validate contents of the adding form.

- Make zope.schema.List widget give consistent ids to its Buttons.

- Make zope.schema.List widget display an error message when its Delete
  button is clicked with no rows selected.

- Fix an issue where the Edit dialog of the zope.schema.List widget wasn't 
  filling in the values for zope.schema.Int fields.

- Fix an issue where the zope.schema.List widget's Edit button wasn't
  bailing out when clicked without a row selected, thus causing
  Javascript errors.

- Fix broken selenium tests.

- Fix issue with the RichText widget when no default value is provided.

- Quell all jslint errors and warnings.

0.16.2 (2010-09-28)
===================

- Revert change made in 0.13.0 that removed the call to the form's
  startup method.
  
0.16.1 (2010-06-29)
===================

- Increased the height of the form used to edit records

0.16.0 (2010-06-09)
===================

- Keep track of window event handlers in the ckeditor widget; handlers are
  added to the zc.dojo.GLOBAL_HANDLERS list.

- Revert change in 0.15.0.

0.15.0 (2010-05-13)
===================

- Added data_files entry to setup.py for `default.css` file added in 0.14.0.

0.14.0 (2010-05-13)
===================

- Added `default.css` to resources, a style sheet that can be used for nicer
  presentation.

- Whitespace/lint cleanup in `zc.dojo.js`.

0.13.0 (2010-04-27)
===================

- Removed call to .startup() on form; it is the client's job to start the form
  after optionally adding additional widgets to it.
- Added a rich text widget (zc.ajaxform.widgets.RichText).
- Made the rich text widget's height and width configurable via display
  options.
- Bug fix: zope.schema.Text was errantly given a rich text widget.  It now uses
  a plain text widget.
- Bug fix (I think): removed some style ("width:100%") from the right
  ContentPane that caused the form to be too wide.

- Added a CKEditor widget as an optional replacement for the Dojo WYSIWYG

- Changed the rich-text display widget to be an `iframe` instead of a full
  Dojo rich-text editor.
